# coolkitty1654's dubious dotfiles
These are my Linux dotfiles for the rices I have made and the ones I am possibly making!

## Requirements

There are a couple of things you'll need to ensure that these config files work properly when you use them.

- hyprland
- hyprpaper
- hyprshot (AUR)
- waybar
- wofi
- wofi-calc (AUR)
- wofi-emoji (AUR)
- dunst
- alacritty
- helvum
- dolphin 
- kde-polkit
- udiskie
- mpv
- wireplumber
- zsh
- p10k zsh theme
- brightnessctl

You'll need Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution with an AUR helper to make use of the AUR packages if you don't want to build them from source.

For Firefox , I use the extension Tabliss to customise my homepage. That's the tabliss.json file within the folders if you would like to use it. You download the files, click the settings icon in the top-left of your homepage and import the .json to customise it!

## Keybinds

Because my keybinds are slightly weird, here's a quick reference for some commonly used ones:

- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to start terminal (alacritty)
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit an application
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to take a screenshot (hyprshot)
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to start the file manager (dolphin)
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd></kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to launch wofi
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to toggle floating
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>1-9</kbd> to switch workspaces
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> to exit Hyprland

(full keybinds at ~/.config/hypr/config/binds.conf)

Below are photos of how the themes look:
